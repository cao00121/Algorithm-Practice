# *Instruction & Requirements*

**Requirements**

The `Function.prototype.bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Source: [*Function.prototype.bind() - Javascript | MDN*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)

**Examples**

```javascript
const john = {
  age: 42,
  getAge: function () {
    return this.age;
  },
};

const unboundGetAge = john.getAge;
console.log(unboundGetAge()); // undefined

const boundGetAge = john.getAge.myBind(john);
console.log(boundGetAge()); // 42
```

**Notes**

Implement your own `Function.prototype.bind` without calling the native bind method. To avoid overwriting the actual `Function.prototype.bind`, implement the function as `Function.prototype.myBind`.

# *My Problem-solving Ideas*

I explored the concept of the `bind` method in JavaScript, which allows us to set the `this` context for a function and predefine arguments for future calls. 

1. My approach to mimicking `bind` involved creating a new function that uses the `apply` method to invoke the original function with a specified `thisArg` and a combination of preset arguments (`argArray`) and additional arguments (`additionalArgs`). 

2. The `concat` method is used to merge these arguments into a single array, ensuring that all parameters are correctly passed to the original function when the bound function is called.

## üëÅ *Knowledge point supplement*

The syntax for the `apply` method is: `function.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])`:

- `thisArg` is the value to be used as this when the function is called;
- `argsArray` is an array or an array-like object whose elements are passed as individual arguments to the function.

## *More understanding about `OOP`*

1. About `Encapsulation`: The `bind` method is encapsulated within the `Function` object in native JavaScript, meaning it is packaged and hidden away from the global scope. This encapsulation ensures that all functions created globally can access and use the `bind` method without needing to define it themselves.

2. About `Inheritance`: All functions inherit the `bind` method from the `Function` object, thanks to JavaScript's prototypal inheritance. This means that every function, by default, has access to the `bind` method without needing to recreate it, demonstrating the power of inheritance in `OOP`.

3. Understanding `OOP`: This exercise has deepened my understanding of `OOP`, particularly the concepts of encapsulation and inheritance. It has shown me how these principles are applied in JavaScript and how they contribute to the language's flexibility and reusability.

**Example**
```javascript
// Assume that we got this function
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

// I have an array contains three numbers
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];

// I can use `apply` method to call the `sum` function with the `numbers` array as arguments:
const result = sum.apply(null, numbers);

console.log(result); // 60
```

In this example, I pass `null` as the `thisArg` to the apply method since the `sum` function does not rely on the this value. The elements of the `numbers` array are passed as individual arguments to the `sum` function, resulting in the calculation of the sum `60`.


# *Better problem-solving ideas*

**Similarities and Differences with Our Approach:**

- **Similarities:** Our implementation also adds the `myBind` method to `Function.prototype` and accepts `thisArg` and `argArray` as parameters. The returned new function also uses the `apply` method to call the original function with the combined arguments.

- **Differences:** The author provides a solution using `Reflect.apply`, an API introduced in ES6 for more explicitly calling functions. Additionally, the author mentions using `Symbol` and `Object.defineProperty` to avoid potential property conflicts.


**Ingenious Aspects of the Author's Solution:**

- **Using `Reflect.apply`:** This approach is more robust because it avoids the reliability risks that may arise from directly calling the `apply` method (e.g., if the original function has a custom property named apply).

- **Using Symbol and Object.defineProperty:** This method creates a unique `Symbol` and adds it as a property to a new object, avoiding conflicts that may arise from adding properties to the original object.

**Reasons for the Robustness of `Reflect.apply`:**

- When directly calling the `apply` method, if there is a custom property or method named `apply` on the original function object, this custom `apply` will be called instead of `Function.prototype.apply`. This may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- Using `Reflect.apply` ensures that the correct `apply` method is always called because `Reflect.apply` is a static method that does not depend on the properties of the function object. This avoids potential property override issues, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the code.


**Reasons for Using `Symbol` to Avoid Conflicts When Adding Properties to the Original Object:**

- In JavaScript, object property names are usually strings. Adding a new property to the original object with an existing property name will overwrite the value of the existing property. This may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

- `Symbol` is a new primitive data type introduced in ES6 that can create unique identifiers. Using `Symbol` as a property name ensures that even if two Symbols have the same description, they are different and will not conflict.

- Using `Symbol` and `Object.defineProperty` to add properties ensures that even if there are existing properties with the same description on the original object, the newly added properties will not conflict with the existing ones, maintaining the integrity and stability of the original object.
